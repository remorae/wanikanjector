# Overview
Wanikanjector replaces English words with their Japanese equivalent in [kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji).

However, there's a catch: By default, only words you've learned from [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com) are replaced.

Features:
- [x] Enable/disable running automatically when loading a tab.
- [x] Blacklist sites to prevent replacing text.
- [x] Hover over words to see the original text.
- [ ] Run on-demand upon clicking a button in the extension pop-up menu.
- [ ] Color-coordinate kanji by level (apprentice, guru, etc.).
- [ ] Optionally highlight learned kanji on sites originally in Japanese.
- [ ] Import custom vocabulary from outside of WaniKani.
- [ ] Hover over words to see hiragana readings.
- [ ] Hover over words to see links to dictionary entries.
- [ ] Generate a list of all kanji/vocabulary that appears on the page.

This extension isn't designed to accurately allow you to read Japanese.
Rather, it's a way of remembering the meanings/readings of Kanji as you go about your day!
