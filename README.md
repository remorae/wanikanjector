# Overview
Wanikanjector replaces English words with their Japanese equivalent in [kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji).

However, there's a catch: By default, only words you've learned from [WaniKani](https://www.wanikani.com) are replaced.

Features:
- Enable/disable globally.
- Color-coordinate kanji by level (apprentice, guru, etc.).
- Optionally highlight learned kanji on sites originally in Japanese.
- Blacklist sites to prevent replacing text.
- Import custom vocabulary from outside of WaniKani.
- Hover over words to see the original text, hiragana readings, and helpful links like dictionary definitions.s
- Generate a list of all kanji/vocabulary that appears on the page.

This extension isn't designed to accurately allow you to read Japanese.
Rather, it's a way of remembering the meanings/readings of Kanji as you go about your day!
